# Information-Retrieval


This repo will contain the labs done during the Information Retrieval course taught by Ilya Markov at the University of Amsterdam. 
- Under *'matching_IR_systems*, we implement traditional matching methods such as term-based matching (Bag of Words model, Tf-IDF, QLM, BM25) and semantic-based matching (LSI, LDA, Word2Vec/Doc2Vec, Re-ranking)
- Under *'learning_to_rank'*, we implement the methods for offline and online learning to rank.
