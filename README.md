# Information-Retrieval

Both Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Information Retrieval (IR) involve dealing with the complexities of human language to extract information. In fact, there is a notable similarity between NLP and IR in the way they handle the user's information needs.

In an IR task, the goal is to find a ranked list of results that fulfill the user's information needs expressed in a query. However, determining the user's information needs from the query can be challenging since it's only a linguistic representation and may not convey the user's actual intent accurately.

Similarly, in NLP tasks, the goal is to extract relevant information from natural language texts such as documents, emails, and social media posts. However, understanding the user's intent behind the text is often complicated by the ambiguity and variability of language.

## Project Structure

- Under *'matching_IR_systems*, we implement traditional matching methods such as term-based matching (Bag of Words model, Tf-IDF, QLM, BM25) and semantic-based matching (LSI, LDA, Word2Vec/Doc2Vec, Re-ranking)
- Under *'learning_to_rank'*, we implement the methods for offline learning to rank.
